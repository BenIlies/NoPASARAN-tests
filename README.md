# Tests

This repository constitutes an **open library** of reviewed tests designed to be executed within the nopasaran framework by workers. Each test is organized into its own folder, containing the necessary JSON files that define the test structure and logic.

## Structure of Test Folders

Each folder in this repository represents a distinct unit test. Within each folder, you will find a set of JSON files that constitute the components of the test. The `MAIN.json` file serves as the entry point, outlining the overall flow and initial conditions for the test.

### Overview and Variables

Inside each test folder, there is a `README.md` file that provides an overview of the test. This README includes:

- **Test Purpose**: A brief description of what the test aims to achieve and validate.
- **Variable Structure**: A detailed explanation of the variables that need to be provided when running the test.
- **Variable Explanations**: A comprehensive guide to understanding the variables used in the test, including what they represent and how they influence the test's outcome.
